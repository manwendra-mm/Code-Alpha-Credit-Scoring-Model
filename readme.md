# Code-Alpha_Credit-Scoring-Model
This project aims to predict loan approval based on various features such as applicant's age, income, employment length, loan amount, etc. The prediction model is built using machine learning techniques, specifically an XGBOOST classifier model. This dataset has been extracted from Kaggle.

## Problem Statement: Credit Scoring Model
Develop a credit scoring model to predict the
creditworthiness of individuals based on historical
financial data. Utilize classification algorithms and
assess the model's accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about loan applicants including their age, income, home ownership status, loan intent, loan grade, loan amount, interest rate, loan status, and other relevant features. It is stored in a CSV file named credit_risk_dataset.csv.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

`credit_risk_dataset.csv`: This is the dataset.

`CodeAlpha_Task3.ipynb`: This file is the colab notebook used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

`readme.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for running the code.

## Getting Started
To run the code in this project, follow these steps:

1) Clone this repository to your local machine.
2) Navigate to the project directory.
3) Install the required dependencies.
4) Explore the dataset and notebook.
5) Run the preprocessing scripts in the notebook to prepare the data for training.
6) Train the machine learning model using the provided scripts.
7) Evaluate the model's performance and make predictions.
